      <h1>BrahMos</h1>
      <div class="accordion-item">
         <p>
            The BrahMos (designated PJ-10) is a medium-range ramjet supersonic cruise missile that can be launched
            from submarine, ships, aircraft, or land. It is the fastest supersonic cruise missile in the world. It
            is a joint venture between the Russian Federation's NPO Mashinostroyeniya and India's Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO), who together have formed BrahMos Aerospace. It is based on the Russian
            P-800 Oniks cruise missile and other similar sea-skimming Russian cruise missile technology. The name
            BrahMos is a portmanteau formed from the names of two rivers, the Brahmaputra of India and the Moskva of
            Russia.
            It is the world's fastest anti-ship cruise missile in operation. The land-launched and
            ship-launched versions are already in service.An air-launched variant of BrahMos appeared in 2012 and
            entered service in 2019. A hypersonic version of the missile, BrahMos-II, is also presently under
            development with a speed of Mach 7–8 to boost aerial fast strike capability. It was expected to be ready for
            testing by 2020

      <h3>Prithvi</h3>
      <div class="accordion-item">
         <p>
            Prithvi (Sanskrit: pṛthvī "Earth") is a tactical surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missile (SRBM)
            developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India under the Integrated Guided
            Missile Development Program (IGMDP). It is deployed by India's Strategic Forces Command.
            The Government of India launched the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program in 1983 to achieve
            self-sufficiency in the development and production of wide range of ballistic missiles, surface-to-air
            missiles etc. Prithvi was the first missile to be developed under the program. DRDO attempted to build a
            surface-to-air missile under Project Devil.Variants make use of either liquid or both liquid and solid
            fuels. Developed as a battlefield missile, it could carry a nuclear warhead in its role as a tactical
            nuclear weapon.

      <h3>Agani</h3>
      <div class="accordion-item">
         <p>
            Agni-V is an Indian nuclear-capable ballistic missile developed by the Defence Research
            and Development Organisation. The missile is believed to have a range of around 5,000 to 8,000 km. Even
            though it's tested range of 5,000 km only qualifies it as an intermediate range missile, it's actual range
            may be greater; Indian officials have described it as an intercontinental missile. It is a three-stage,
            road-mobile and solid-fueled missile which is transported by a truck and launched via a canister. Its first
            flight was conducted in 2012.
